## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I recently organized the 10th Birthday party of my Kid. He invited eighteen friends to celebrate with him. Everyone bought a gift for him, but he was not content with any. He was looking for a gaming console, and itâ€™s obvious that this is not expected to be a gift from his friends as it would be too expensive for one person to buy. Then I realized that the amount of each gift was an average of 20 dollars, and all his gifts together were worth around 360 dollars. With this amount, he could buy a gaming console and a game! 

<p>Then I though what if his friends could know about his wish for the gaming console and share a small amount of money towards the gaming console.  So, this idea encouraged me to build a web application that will provide a platform for Kids to publish their wish list; Invite friends, Invitee (friends) can see the wish list and share their gift as a small amount of money to fulfill the wish.</p>
